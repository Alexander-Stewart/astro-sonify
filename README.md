# astro-sonify
Work for Smithsonian Observatory Sonification project

# goal
To create a kind of sonification of 3D astronomy data.

# steps

The two important components are control over sound sources and an
absolute positioning system.  We want to be able to vary sound by
amplitude or pitch according to our location in space, and we also
want to be able to control the position in space absolutely.  Both
components are necessary.


1. Read OBJ file.

2. Absolute positioning.  (Suggest doing it by relative position of
   hand controllers, happy to hear other ideas.)
   
3. Sound control: pitch, timbre, volume, whatever, as a function of
   position.
