# Scenes Folder

The scenes folder contains all of the scenes that are being used in the project. They include different movement systems,
scenes to test sound, and scenes for other various plugins and assets that I was testing on their own. The main folders that contain
items that are complete and would want to be looked at can be found in the folders "Completed Movements" and "87a".
